                    <h3>Ludonarrative Resonance</h3>
                    <p>
                        When approaching this project, it was important to me to use the medium of video game storytelling to its full potential -- otherwise, why not write a book?
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Video games are still a nascent art form and are the medium that gives its audience the most agency. 
                        This allows for a connection with the audience emotionally in a way no other form can. 
                        One way it does this is through ludonarrative resonance.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Ludonarrative resonance is when the gameplay mechanics and themes of the story resonate with each other, 
                        elevating the whole to a new level.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Within Sunset High, the main theme I explore is obsession. This begs the question: how do we achieve 
                        ludonarrative resonance with the theme of obsession in mind? This was done through a couple of mechanics 
                        and design decisions:
                    </p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Limited Play Space</strong><br>
                            By setting the game almost entirely within a classroom, the player had to entirely focus on the 
                            classroom to solve the mystery. We reward an attention to detail, which is not too far from obsession.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            <strong>Time Loop</strong><br>
                            By making the game operate under a time loop, the player had to focus on what was in front of them 
                            again and again. This could be considered a negative gameplay loop because players generally do not 
                            like seeing their progress reset.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            <strong>Expansive Decision Tree</strong><br>
                            By giving the player an expansive decision tree, where small changes lead to different causal events, 
                            we allow the player to feel as if their decisions matter.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            <strong>Rewind / Fast Forward</strong><br>
                            These mechanics allow for ease of traversal through the aforementioned decision tree. They act as 
                            positive feedback mechanisms, empowering the player to quickly and easily hop from node to node. 
                            Rewind allows exploration of branches very quickly, while Fast Forward allows players to identify 
                            key nodes in the tree and move to them efficiently.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>
                        Together, these mechanics and design decisions combined make the player obsessive, which allows our 
                        emotional storytelling climax to hit the audience in a way entirely unique to the medium of video games.

                <h3>The Dialogue Pipeline</h3>
                <p>
                    In a branching narrative game containing over 80,000 words and dozens of interwoven objectives, 
                    managing dialogue flow, localization, and quest logic presented a serious technical challenge. 
                    Solving this challenge was tantamount.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    It starts with Twine, which is an open source branching narrative editor. From here, we have to get it 
                    into the game. The base <code>.twee</code> format did not give us the flexibility to fire in-game events, 
                    so instead we expanded a JSON library to parse the Twine files as needed to create a JSON structure that 
                    could be consumed by our custom dialogue engine in game.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The plugin can be seen here: <a href="https://github.com/ErraticUnicorn/twine-to-json-to-godot" target="_blank">
                    https://github.com/ErraticUnicorn/twine-to-json-to-godot</a>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Within Godot, we create a conversation data model which is a tree with two types of nodes. A dialogue node, 
                    and a reply node, where replies lead to other dialogue nodes. These trees allow localization out of the box 
                    and the firing of various in game events.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Finally, these conversations live within Objectives, which give us the skeleton of the game -- our quest system. 
                    Our quests rely on Directed Acyclic Graphs to hold and chain objectives together.
                </p>

                <p class="tech-dive-image-caption">Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure used for the quest system</p>
                
                <p>
                    To edit these quickly and efficiently, I designed a custom Godot plugin to visually edit these DAGs as can be 
                    seen below, which shows a sidequest in our game.
                </p>

                <p class="tech-dive-image-caption">Custom Godot plugin for visually editing quest DAGs</p>
                
                <p>
                    This system enabled rapid iteration on branching narratives, seamless localization, and dynamic in-game 
                    event triggering -- all essential to a narrative-driven title like Sunset High.

                <h3>Rewind System</h3>
                <p>
                    Allowing the player to rewind anything, everywhere, all at once, as far back as they want, can easily get out of hand. 
                    Maintaining performance and controlling memory usage were essential for making this mechanic viable.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    To solve this, I designed a system where all game state is serialized into lightweight snapshots using primitive types, 
                    stored in one of two ways:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Pollable Snapshots:</strong> Every engine tick, we poll the object's state. If it's changed, a new snapshot is created 
                        and added to storage. If it's unchanged, we increment a frame_count within the latest snapshot. This is ideal for 
                        frequently changing objects, like player position.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Event-Based Snapshots:</strong> Objects with infrequent state changes (like objectives) emit an event to create 
                        a snapshot when their state updates. On every tick, their latest snapshot's frame_count is incremented instead of polling.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                    At rewind time, we maintain an array of snapshots per object, each snapshot containing the relevant serialized state 
                    and how many frames it persisted for. Moving backward through time means decrementing frame_count values, and when a 
                    count reaches zero, popping to the previous snapshot and applying its state.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This hybrid approach allowed us to balance flexibility with performance, delivering a seamless rewind mechanic while 
                    maintaining a consistent 60 frames per second, even across large, dynamic scenes.
